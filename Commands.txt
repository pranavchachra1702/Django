1. Command to make project folder in Django:
       "django-admin startproject <project-folder-name>"
Eg: django-admin startproject mysite

2. To start Django Server:
	i. Navigate inside mysite folder from Virtual environment using "cd mysite")

	ii. This mysite folder will contain another mysite sub-folder inside it along with a manage.py file and project folder structure would look like:
		mysite (folder)
		|
		|--- mysite (sub-folder)
		|--- manage.py
	iii. Run "python manage.py runserver": Django server starts on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ & now project folder structure becomes:
 		mysite (folder) : app folder and project folder is made inside this folder
 		|
 		|___ mysite (sub-folder) [this is Project folder]
 		|___ manage.py
		|___ db.sqlite3

4. Install DB Browser for SQLite using this Link: 
	https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/
	(Standard Installer for 64-bit Installer)

5. The mysite sub-folder (This is the project folder) contains 5 files:
	|--- __init__.py: Initialize mysite as a package folder
	|--- asgi.py: (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) :
	|    (This file is changed when hosting is done on cloud server]
	|--- wsgi.py: (Web Server Gateway Interface)
	|	(Above 2 are Django server's configuration files) [Not to be changed]
	|--- settings.py:
	|	All settings(like Database Connections, etc.) are done in this file
	|--- urls.py:
	|	This  file  contains  the  listed  URLs  of  the  application.  In  this  file,  we  can 
		mention the urls and corresponding actions to perform the task and display the view.
		(In this we get a 'path' method which we use to make URLs (Routing))
		(All URL's of a website are registered here)


6. Command to make app folder:
	"python manage.py startapp <app-folder name>"

Eg: python manage.py startapp demo
		Now if server is run using "python manage.py runserver" then it shows this warning:
			You have 18 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.
		(This means Project folder and app folder created are not linked yet)
		Fix: Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.
			On running this by default 11 tables get created in Database

		demo folder contains these files:
		|--- __init__.py: Initializes app folder
		|--- admin.py: To register models on admin panel. Until a model is registered here we cant see it on admin pannel
		|--- apps.py: 
		|--- models.py:
		|--- tests.py:
		|--- views.py:
	

7. admin.py:

	When we use "python manage.py runserver", Django server runs on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
	Now if we navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin : we see a Dialog Box with Username & Password field. We need to generate these

	Command to generate: 
		"python manage.py createsuperuser"...After running this, it will ask for username, email-id and Password; so we can enter anything for now:


Password (again):
The password is too similar to the username.
This password is too short. It must contain at least 8 characters.
This password is too common.
Bypass password validation and create user anyway? [y/N]: y (press 'y)
Superuser created successfully.


After this again run the server and enter username and password
